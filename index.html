<!--Have an issue with the footer not recognising the end of the page based on the length of the posts list.  At the moment this has been overcome by making the main content of the page longer, and limiting the number of posts displayed in the list. A max height for the posts list can be set within the layout.scss, and a scroll bar will then be displayed as the length of the list increases.-->
