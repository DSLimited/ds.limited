# Cloud Services
At Deneb solutions we are passionate about maximising the benefits of cloud services. We will give it to you straight, and enable your business to use the cloud in the way you want and help guide you towards the industry best practices.

# Green Field architecture
Starting a new application, now is the most exciting time for writing applications. Cloud services now enable your business to develop in new ways that will minimise your operational expenditure, maximise your security and allow you to get new features in customer hands quicker than ever. Lambda functions mixed with API gateway and Dynamo DB is a proven scalable solution that can enable you to go live with the first version within days and add new features (and fixes) within hours.

# Container systems
If your using Fleet, Swarm, Kubernetes or Mesos your probably already using Cloud services to provide the underlying compute power, Deneb Solutions Limited can help by providing ad hock support services when your short staffed or during high project workloads.

# Legacy systems
Cloud services can still be utilised to enhance legacy systems that are lifted and shifted into the cloud. 

# OS
One question we are often asked is how about licencing? Utilising Cloud Services can be done with your current licences for some services (Bring your own licence - BYOL) but the majority of Cloud Services include the cost of licencing in the service charge. This has a major benefit allowing you to only pay for the licence and compute cost you use by the hour (in some services this can be down to the second usage cost).
This includes Windows, Red Hat and most Database server licences
