# What?

Simply put Infrastructure as code is a developmental process of defining a computer system in a codified terms and then using tools that automate the building of a system based on that definition. 

It is not something new, however, what is new is the level of automation that can be achieved. When this automation is leveraged it will bring benefits that would have been almost unbelievable only a decade ago.  

# Why?

Infrastructure as Code brings repeatability, with repeatability you get some level of recovery for free. 

Infrastructure as Code plus versioning leverages repeatability to points in time (ask a software developer about the differences between v1.0 and v2.0 of a code base)

The process of writing Infrastructure as Code allows a software development model of iterative improvement, rapid prototyping, write once use many times, agility by failing fast and refactoring and collaboration that is rarely seen in traditional Infrastructure teams.

Infrastructure as Code enables alerting on divergence which is a great tool in the fight to keep your systems secure and changes made with control.

Infrastructure as Code facilitates advanced documentation and monitoring tools to update with the infrastructure not as a manual process or afterthought.

With traditional infrastructure you need to run a discovery tool with Infrastructure as Code you find the value from the code and confirm there has been no divergence.

# Where?

You and your organisation need a deep desire to learn. Some of the tools are complex and most are designed for software developers.
You need management buy in for the results.


# When?

You have probably been doing it for years without realising. The next step is to leverage the tools that have the most impact on your Infrastructure.

# How?

Take your architecture diagram and build docs. They are the first alpha version of your Infrastructure as Code. Think about it, it is your infrastructure represented as a code of images, keys and words. The problem is this version can't be easily run through a tool to make your system. Conversely you can't look at a value in your architecture diagram and know for sure that is the real world value.

Next step is to start looking for tools and making decisions on how your organisation is going to value and what it is not. From there you can start to plan how you get to Infrastructure as Code nirvana.
