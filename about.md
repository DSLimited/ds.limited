I have been working int he IT industry for over 15 years and I am contantly learning and surprised by the technology industry.  I started out working in Infrastructure, hard wiring servers and spending hours in data centres running analytical programs to increase the performance of the hardware at my disposal.

Now I work as a consultant Senior Cloud Engineer doing lots of interesting things that my wife and, sometimes, even I don't understand...
